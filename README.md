# Second code challenge Back-end - Bootcamp

Second code challenge, putting in practice that we learn in the first week.

## ðŸ“Ÿ What I learned
React.JS | Babel | Webpack | useState | useEffect 

## Instructions

First, if you don't have Node.js you'll need to install it:
* You can do a manual install from here: `https://nodejs.org/en/`. This will include Node and its package manager, `npm`.

* If you are on a Mac and using Homebrew you can do the following:
  + `brew install node --without-npm` (`npm` and Homebrew don't play well together)
  + `curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh` (so, install `npm` separately)


Once you've got Node installed:
* `git clone git@github.com/Igorth/challenge-front-end-react`
* `cd challenge-front-end-react`
* `yarn` to install dependencies
* `yarn start` to start the project
* `yarn test` to start the tests
* Check out the repo to see the git history: `https://github.com/Igorth/challenge-front-end-react`
